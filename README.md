Embedded (Nested) Models Extension for Yii 2
============================================

In particular it allows working with sub-documents in MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

Installation
------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist yii2tech/embedded
```

or add

```json
"yii2tech/embedded": "*"
```

to the require section of your composer.json.


Usage
-----

This extension grants the ability to work with complex model attributes, represented as arrays, as nested models,
represented as objects.
To use this feature the target class should implement [[\yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface]] interface.
This can be easily achieved using [[\yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait]].

For each embedded entity a mapping declaration should be provided.
In order to do so you need to declare method, which name is prefixed with 'embedded', which
should return the [[Mapping]] instance. You may use [[hasEmbedded()]] and [[hasEmbeddedList()]] for this.

Per each of source field or property a new virtual property will declared, which name will be composed
by removing 'embedded' prefix from the declaration method name.

> Note: watch for the naming collisions: if you have a source property named 'profile' the mapping declaration
  for it should have different name, like 'profileModel'.


Example:

```php
use yii\base\Model;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait;

class User extends Model implements ContainerInterface
{
    use ContainerTrait;

    public $profileData = []; // Declare variable inside model is important
    public $commentsData = [];

    public function embedProfile()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbedded('profileData', Profile::className());
    }

    public function embedComments()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbeddedList('commentsData', Comment::className());
    }
}

$user = new User();
$user->profile->firstName = 'John';
$user->profile->lastName = 'Doe';

$comment = new Comment();
$user->comments[] = $comment;
```

Each embedded mapping may have additional options specified. Please refer to [[\yii2tech\embedded\Mapping]] for more details.


## Processing embedded objects <span id="processing-embedded-objects"></span>

Embedded feature is similar to regular ActiveRecord relation feature. Their declaration and processing are similar
and have similar specifics and limitations.
All embedded objects are lazy loaded. This means they will not be created until first demand. This saves memory
but may produce unexpected results at some point.
By default, once embedded object is instantiated its source attribute will be unset in order to save memory usage.
You can control this behavior via [[\yii2tech\embedded\Mapping::unsetSource]].

Embedded objects allow simplification of nested data processing, but usually they know nothing about their source
data meaning and global processing. For example: nested object is not aware if its source data comes from database
and it does not know how this data should saved. Such functionality usually is handled by container object.
Thus at some point you will need to convert data from embedded objects back to its raw format, which allows its
native processing like saving. This can be done using method `refreshFromEmbedded()`:

```php
use yii\base\Model;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait;

class User extends Model implements ContainerInterface
{
    use ContainerTrait;

    public $profileData = [
        'firstName' => 'Unknown',
        'lastName' => 'Unknown',
    ];

    public function embedProfile()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbedded('profileData', Profile::className());
    }
}

$user = new User();
var_dump($user->profileData); // outputs array: ['firstName' => 'Unknown', 'lastName' => 'Unknown']

$user->profile->firstName = 'John';
$user->profile->lastName = 'Doe';

var_dump($user->profileData); // outputs empty array

$user->refreshFromEmbedded();
var_dump($user->profileData); // outputs array: ['firstName' => 'John', 'lastName' => 'Doe']
```

While embedding list of objects (using [[\yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait::mapEmbeddedList()]]) the produced
virtual field will be not an array, but an object, which satisfies [[\ArrayAccess]] interface. Thus all manipulations
with such property (even if it may look like using array) will affect container object.
For example:

```php
use yii\base\Model;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait;

class User extends Model implements ContainerInterface
{
    use ContainerTrait;

    public $commentsData = [];

    public function embedComments()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbeddedList('commentsData', Comment::className());
    }
}

$user = new User();
// ...

$comments = $user->comments; // not a copy of array - copy of object reference!
foreach ($comments as $key => $comment) {
    if (...) {
        unset($comments[$key]); // unsets `$user->comments[$key]`!
    }
}

$comments = clone $user->comments; // creates a copy of list, but not a copy of contained objects!
$comments[0]->title = 'new value'; // actually sets `$user->comments[0]->title`!
```


## Validating embedded models <span id="validating-embedded-models"></span>

Each embedded model should declare its own validation rules and, in general, should be validated separately.
However, you may simplify complex model validation using [[\yii2tech\embedded\Validator]].
For example:

```php
use yii\base\Model;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface;
use yii2tech\embedded\ContainerTrait;

class User extends Model implements ContainerInterface
{
    use ContainerTrait;

    public $contactData;

    public function embedContact()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbedded('contactData', Contact::className());
    }

    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            ['contact', 'yii2tech\embedded\Validator'],
        ]
    }
}

class Contact extends Model
{
    public $email;

    public function rules()
    {
        return [
            ['email', 'required'],
            ['email', 'email'],
        ]
    }
}

$user = new User();
if ($user->populate(Yii::$app->request->post()) && $user->contact->populate(Yii::$app->request->post())) {
    if ($user->validate()) { // automatically validates 'contact' as well
        // ...
    }
}
```


## Predefined model classes <span id="predefined-model-classes"></span>

This extension is generic and may be applied to any model with complex attributes. However, to simplify integration with
common solutions several base classes are provided by this extension:
 - [[\yii2tech\embedded\mongodb\ActiveRecord]] - MongoDB ActiveRecord with embedded feature built-in
 - [[\yii2tech\embedded\mongodb\ActiveRecordFile]] - MongoDB GridFS ActiveRecord with embedded feature built-in
 - [[\yii2tech\embedded\elasticsearch\ActiveRecord]] - ElasticSearch ActiveRecord with embedded feature built-in

Provided ActiveRecord classes already implement [[\yii2tech\embedded\ContainerInterface]] and invoke `refreshFromEmbedded()`
on `beforeSave()` stage.
For example, if you are using MongoDB and wish to work with sub-documents, you may simply switch extending from
regular [[\yii\mongodb\ActiveRecord]] to [[\yii2tech\embedded\mongodb\ActiveRecord]]:

```php
class User extends \yii2tech\embedded\mongodb\ActiveRecord
{
    public static function collectionName()
    {
        return 'customer';
    }

    public function attributes()
    {
        return ['_id', 'name', 'email', 'addressData', 'status'];
    }

    public function embedAddress()
    {
        return $this->mapEmbedded('addressData', UserAddress::className());
    }
}
```
